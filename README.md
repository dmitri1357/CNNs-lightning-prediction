# CNNs-lightning-prediction
This codebase was developed for the CNNs lightning prediction project, which produced two manuscripts: "Predicting Cloud-to-Ground Lightning in the Western United States from the Large-Scale Environment using Explainable Neural Networks" by Kalashnikov et al. (2024) and "Projections of Lightning-Ignited Wildfire Risk in the Western United States" by Kalashnikov et al. (2025). The associated datasets which this code uses are stored in the following open-access repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10685571.
